# Donation-food

 
Project Description
The main aim of this project is to stop food waste. Often, food left in hotels or homes is thrown into the dustbin. This project provides a platform for people to donate that food to those in need.
How the Project Works
Hotel Form Submission:
Donors (hotels) enter the name of the hotel, food description, address, phone number, and the time until which the food will be available for pick-up.
Once the form is submitted, it is forwarded to the food list.
Food List:
Users can see the food items submitted by hotels, including the food description, address, phone number, and pick-up time.
If a user wants a food item, they can select it, and the item will be removed from the list.
